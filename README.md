# Ext4-Unlocker
Changes permissions of external Ext4 disks.

This program allows you to set write and ownership permissions on Ext4 FS disks connected to your Linux system via a USB port to allow you to use them as storage. Normally, when you connect an Ext4-formatted disk directly to your system, you won't be able to write to or delete it. This is because Ext4 disks operate on a permission and ownership logic. By changing these settings, this program allows you to use your Ext4 disks as portable storage, just like MS NTFS, FAT32, or exFAT. You can also restore the permissions if you wish.

The program does not include dynamic language support and only supports English and Turkish. By default, it opens in English.
